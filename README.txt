This is a game of tic tac toe that you can play with your friends with the help of Java Graphics! 

Algorithm:

I have used one big JPanel with a JFrame and 2 JLabels on top,
which displays the game stats and whose turn it is. On the left of the labels, there is a button to reset the game whenever the 
players want to. 

As the game board, I have first tried using mouseListener, however after couple of days of trying to figure out how to implement the mouseListener,
I have decided to switch to using 9 different buttons, (button0 to button8). Each button has a listener which allows them to display the next
player's move. I have also utilized the paintComponent to draw the grid of the Tic Tac Toe board (4 seperate lines).

Thank you!
